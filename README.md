## What is Kubernetes?
- Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start.
